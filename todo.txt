> server should run /var/www/html/proxy 'sudo node cors-proxy.js' to proxy requests to rss feeds

> for running locally, run 'npm run dev' and go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ and request temporary access to the dev server

> features implemented:
	> function to read the time (date is not super useful i think that can be removed?)
	> load 20 first entries and load 20 more each scroll
	> time since article posted instead of pubDate
	> change link to display article summary / description
	> sort article by time published instead of by source
	> design work - figure out if user is on mobile and adapt design
	> function to cut the description or to fit it inside a box

> features to implement:
	> log unique visitors (IP, date, time, user agent)
	> fix Git repo and instructions to run locally / contribute
	> some function to scrape / display the full article text from the ArticlePage
	> filter by source, filter by category
	> login / register / save preferences
	
> broken:
	> wait until everything is loaded to display articles on the main page? maybe not the pictures.. 
	...or maybe load the first 20 pictures first after sorting by when everything was published?
