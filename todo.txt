> server should run /var/www/html/proxy 'sudo node cors-proxy.js' to proxy requests to rss feeds

> for running locally, run 'npm run dev' and go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ and request temporary access to the dev server

> features implemented:
	> function to read the time (date is not super useful i think that can be removed?)
	> load 20 first entries and load 20 more each scroll
	> time since article posted instead of pubDate
	> change link to display article summary / description
	> sort article by time published instead of by source
	> design work - figure out if user is on mobile and adapt design
	> function to cut the description or to fit it inside a box
	> log unique visitors (IP, date, time, user agent)
	> function to scrape / display the full article text from the ArticlePage
	> about, sources page
	> darken post when its been clicked already
	> (mobile) Burger menu / banner pinned to top
	> (mobile) thin row under burger menu with refresh button
	> fix time on ArticlePage to be in the user's timezone
	> push "refreshed x mins ago" down a few px on mobile
	> should be able to click outside burger menu to close it (right now it opens an article)
	> say "refreshing" on refresh before saying last refresh just now
	> longer loading time now.. is it waiting for everything to be loaded to not display the spinner anymore?

> features to implement:
	> fix Git repo and instructions to run locally / contribute
	> filter by source, filter by category
	> login / register / save preferences
	> customize sources, maybe toggle on "sources" page
	> configure proxy server to run on server restart
	> fix flickering when back to main feed
	> collapsible categories on sources page
	> selectable categories and sources
	> make it so there's no content past the content area when user scrolls past it on mobile - 
		can still see whitespace below the banner if scroll past content at the top
	> check timing of resetting scroll before spinwheel - sometimes wheel doesnt show on mobile, when scrolled down

	


> broken:
	> content getting squished on mobile when sidebar is open - sidebar should overlay content (but just on mobile)
	> is it waiting until it has all all high res pics before displaying them? could display them as it fetches, one by one, starting from the top.
		> some are appearing way after the page has loaded
		> would be better to populate the pic as we fetch images, not sure what's going on there but it seems they're all loading at once and not trickling in until i change page and come back
